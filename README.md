# A Collection of DL-based Dehazing Methods

This repository provides a summary of deep learning based point cloud registration algorithms. 

We classify registration algorithms into supervised and unsupervised, as follows.

[Supervised Point Cloud Registration Methods](#supervised)
 * [1. Descriptor Extraction](#s-1)
   * [1.1 Keypoint-based](#s-1-1)

[Unsupervised Point Cloud Registration Methods](#unsupervised)
